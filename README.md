## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/image-1.png)

There are many great libraries out there to build a tree structure in Javascript. But none of them were simple use or in my case let you build a family tree specifically with multiple scenarios; such as supporting more than one partners or step/foster/adopted children. 

This simple tree generator takes your JSON data and builds a family tree using fabricjs on a HTML canvas. 

## Built With

Vanilla Typescript with [fabricjs](http://fabricjs.com/) and packaged using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
